Compare the Java and Scala programming languages

1.  Scala is a pure object oriented programming language as every value in Scala is an object.
    Java is not a pure object oriented programming language as it uses primitive data types.

2.  Scala is a statically typed language which does type checking at compile time.
    Java is a dynamically typed language which does type checking at run time.
    Java can be compiled even with errors but Scala cannot be compiled until errors are fixed.

3.  Scala supports operator overloading and Java does not.

4.  Scala variables are by default immutable and Java variables are by default mutable.

5. Scala code are less readable due to nested functions and Java codes are more readable.
